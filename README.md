## Detailed Explaination
1. In this course project, I have build a Polynomial regression model and the Prophet library, and then we will train out model on the training dataset which contains stocks prices for the past 20 years of data.

2. Training data contains 80% of the data and remaining 20% is used as Testing dataset.

3. Our main goal is to predict the close price of our stock for the next year and we have hit good overall accis and achieved accuracy with our results.
